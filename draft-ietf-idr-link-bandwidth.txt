1.  Introduction

   Load balancing is a critical aspect of network design, enabling
   efficient utilization of available bandwidth and improving overall
   network performance.  Traditional equal-cost multi-path (ECMP)
   routing does not account for the varying capacities of different
   paths.  This document suggests that the external link bandwidth be
   carried in the network using a new extended community [RFC4360] - the
   link bandwidth extended community.  The Link Bandwidth Extended
   Community provides a mechanism for routers to advertise the bandwidth
   of their links, facilitating maximum utilisation of paths.

2.  Link Bandwidth Extended Community

   The Link Bandwidth Extended Community is defined as a BGP extended
   community that carries the bandwidth information of a link connecting
   to a neighbor.  This community can be used to inform other routers
   about the available bandwidth on a given link.

Internet-Draft    BGP Link Bandwidth Extended Community      August 2024


   The extended community can be optional transitive or non-transitive.
   The value of the high-order octet of the extended Type Field can be
   0x00 or 0x40.  The value of the low-order octet of the extended type
   field for this community is 0x04.  The value of the Global
   Administrator subfield in the Value Field SHOULD represent the
   Autonomous System of the router that attaches the Link Bandwidth
   Community.  If four octet AS numbering scheme is used [RFC6793],
   AS_TRANS should be used in the Global Administrator subfield.  The
   bandwidth of the link is expressed as 4 octets in IEEE floating point
   format, units being bytes (not bits!) per second.  It is carried in
   the Local Administrator subfield of the Value Field.

3.  Protocol Procedures

3.1.  Sender (Originating Link Bandwidth Community)

   An originator of the link bandwidth community SHOULD be able to
   originate either a transitive or a non-transitive link bandwidth
   extended community.  Implementation SHOULD provide configuration to
   set the transitivity type of the link bandwidth community. No more
   than one link bandwidth extended community SHALL be attached to a
   route.

3.2.  Receiver (Receiving link bandwidth community)

   A BGP receiver MUST be able to process link bandwidth community of
   both transitive or non-transitive type.  The receiver SHOULD NOT flap
   or treat the route as malformed based on the transitivity of the link
   bandwidth community.

3.3.  Re-advertisement Procedures

3.3.1.  Re-advertisement with Next hop Self

   When a BGP speaker re-advertises a route with the Link Bandwidth
   Extended Community and sets the next hop to itself, it SHOULD follow
   the same procedures as outlined in Section 3.1.

3.3.2.  Re-advertisement with Next Hop Unchanged

   A BGP speaker that receives a route with link bandwidth community,
   re-advertises or reflects the same without changing its next hop
   SHOULD NOT change the link bandwidth extended community in any way.

4.  Error Handling

   If a receiver receives a route with more than one Link Bandwidth
   Extended Community, it SHOULD:

Internet-Draft    BGP Link Bandwidth Extended Community      August 2024


      Prefer the lowest value of the attached link bandwidth community
      (Irrespective of the transitivity)

      Prefer the transitive Link Bandwidth Extended Community when
      choosing between transitive and non-transitive types that have the
      same value

   Implementations MAY provide configuration options (knobs) to change
   the above preference.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a specific application of the two-octet AS
   specific extended community.  IANA is requested to assign a sub- type
   value of 0x04 for the link bandwidth extended community.

       Name                                           Value
       ----                                           -----
       non-transitive Link Bandwidth Ext. Community   0x4004

       Name                                           Value
       ----                                           -----
       transitive Link Bandwidth Ext. Community       0x0004

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no additional security risks introduced by this design.
